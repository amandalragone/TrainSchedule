This is a simple Train Schedule calculator. The user enters the name of the train and its destination, along with the time when the first train leaves and its frequency.

When clicking Submit, the train name, destination and frequency will be appended to the table above the form. Instead of displaying the first train time, the page will calculate when the next train will leave and will display that time and how many minutes remain until then.
